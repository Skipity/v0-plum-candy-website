          I want you to absolutely love your copy of Plum Candy! If for any reason you're not completely satisfied with your purchase, I've got you covered with a straightforward return policy.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">30-Day Return Window</h2>
        <p>
          You have <strong>30 days</strong> from the date you receive your book to return it for a full refund. No questions asked, no hassle. I get it – sometimes things don't work out, and that's totally okay.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What Can Be Returned</h2>
        <p>
          I accept returns on all book editions:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Trade Paperbacks</strong> - As long as they're in good condition</li>
          <li><strong>Premium Hardcovers</strong> - Same deal, just keep them nice</li>
          <li><strong>Signed Collector's Editions</strong> - Even these can be returned, though it makes me a little sad!</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The books should be in the same condition you received them – no major damage, excessive wear, or missing pages. A little reading wear is totally fine; I expect you to actually read the book!
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How to Return Your Book</h2>
        <p>
          Returning a book is super easy:
        </p>
        <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><a href="/contact" class="text-purple-700 hover:text-purple-900">Contact me</a> to let me know you'd like to return your book</li>
          <li>I'll send you a return shipping label (on me!)</li>
          <li>Pack up the book securely and send it back</li>
          <li>Once I receive it, I'll process your refund within 3-5 business days</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          If you ordered through PayPal, your refund will go back to your original payment method. Easy peasy!
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Return Shipping</h2>
        <p>
          Here's the deal with shipping costs:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>If the book arrived damaged or defective</strong> - I'll cover all return shipping costs and send you a replacement immediately</li>
          <li><strong>If you just changed your mind</strong> - I'll still provide a prepaid return label because I want this to be hassle-free for you</li>
          <li><strong>International returns</strong> - Let's chat about the best way to handle this case by case</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Exchanges</h2>
        <p>
          Want to exchange your Trade Paperback for a Premium Hardcover? Or switch your Collector's Edition number? Just <a href="/contact" class="text-purple-700 hover:text-purple-900">let me know</a> what you'd like to do. I'm flexible and want to make sure you get exactly what you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          If there's a price difference, we'll sort that out easily through PayPal.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Damaged or Defective Books</h2>
        <p>
          If your book arrives damaged or has printing defects, I'm really sorry! This stuff happens sometimes despite our best efforts. Just <a href="/contact" class="text-purple-700 hover:text-purple-900">reach out to me</a> with a photo of the issue, and I'll send you a replacement right away – no need to return the damaged copy first.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Special Circumstances</h2>
        <p>
          Life happens, and sometimes 30 days isn't enough. If you have a special situation – maybe you were traveling, dealing with a family emergency, or the book got lost in your mail pile – just <a href="/contact" class="text-purple-700 hover:text-purple-900">talk to me</a>. I'm a human being, and I understand that life gets complicated sometimes.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Questions?</h2>
