          Welcome to my little corner of the internet! These terms and conditions outline the rules and regulations for purchasing books from me. I've tried to keep this as friendly and straightforward as possible – no legal jargon that requires a law degree to understand.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">The Basics</h2>
        <p>
          By ordering a book from this website, you're agreeing to these terms. If something doesn't make sense or you have questions, please <a href="/contact" class="text-purple-700 hover:text-purple-900">reach out to me</a> – I'm always happy to clarify!
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Orders and Payment</h2>
        <p>
          When you place an order, you're making an offer to purchase a book from me. I'll accept that offer when I process your payment and send you a confirmation email. All payments are processed securely through PayPal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prices are listed in US dollars and include applicable sales tax. I reserve the right to update prices, but any changes won't affect orders you've already placed.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Shipping and Delivery</h2>
        <p>
          I'll do my best to get your book to you as quickly as possible! Here's what you can expect:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Processing time:</strong> 1-3 business days to prepare your order</li>
          <li><strong>Shipping time:</strong> Varies by location, but typically 3-7 business days within the US</li>
          <li><strong>International shipping:</strong> 1-3 weeks depending on your country's postal service</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I'll send you tracking information once your book ships. If your package gets lost or damaged in transit, <a href="/contact" class="text-purple-700 hover:text-purple-900">let me know</a> and we'll figure out a solution together.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Collector's Edition Numbering</h2>
        <p>
          For Signed Collector's Editions, here's how the numbering works:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Specific numbers:</strong> If you purchase a specific number (like #007), that's exactly what you'll get</li>
          <li><strong>"Next Available":</strong> I'll assign you the next available number in the sequence</li>
          <li><strong>"Pick Your Number":</strong> You can request a specific available number, subject to availability</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each Collector's Edition is hand-signed and numbered, making it truly unique. I take great care to ensure the authenticity and quality of each copy.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>
          The content on this website, including the text of Plum Candy, images, and design, belongs to me (Aaliyah Corley) unless otherwise noted. You're welcome to share excerpts for reviews or discussions, but please don't reproduce large portions without permission.
        </p>
        <p>
          When you buy a book, you're purchasing a physical copy for your personal use. You're not buying the rights to reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from the content.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Returns and Refunds</h2>
        <p>
          I want you to be happy with your purchase! Check out my detailed <a href="/return-policy" class="text-purple-700 hover:text-purple-900">Return Policy</a> for all the specifics, but the short version is: you have 30 days to return any book for a full refund, no questions asked.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          I respect your privacy and only collect the information I need to fulfill your order and improve your experience. For all the details, check out my <a href="/privacy-policy" class="text-purple-700 hover:text-purple-900">Privacy Policy</a>.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          I'll do everything I can to provide you with a great experience, but I can't be held responsible for things beyond my control – like shipping delays, payment processing issues, or your cat knocking your book off the table.
        </p>
        <p>
          My liability is limited to the amount you paid for your book. I know that sounds formal, but it's just standard business protection stuff.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>
          I might need to update these terms occasionally. If I do, I'll post the changes here and update the date below. For significant changes, I'll try to give you a heads up if I have your contact information.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
          These terms are governed by the laws of the United States. If we ever have a dispute (which I hope we won't!), we'll try to work it out like reasonable people first.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Contact Me</h2>
        <p>
          If you have any questions about these terms, need clarification on anything, or just want to chat about the book, please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact" class="text-purple-700 hover:text-purple-900">contact me</a>. I'm always happy to help!
        </p>
