          Hey there! I'm Aaliyah, and I want to be completely transparent about how I handle your information. This isn't one of those scary legal documents written by robots – it's just me explaining how I protect your privacy while running my little book business.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">What Information I Collect</h2>
        <p>
          When you order a book from me, I need some basic info to get it to you: your name, email address, and shipping address. If you contact me through the <a href="/contact" class="text-purple-700 hover:text-purple-900">contact page</a>, I'll have whatever you choose to share with me in your message.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also use some standard web analytics to understand how people use my site – things like which pages are popular and where visitors come from. This helps me make the site better, but it's all anonymous data.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How I Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>
          Pretty straightforward stuff here:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>To process and ship your book orders</li>
          <li>To send you updates about your order (like tracking info)</li>
          <li>To respond to your messages if you contact me</li>
          <li>To improve my website and understand what readers want</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I won't spam you with marketing emails unless you specifically ask for updates about new books or projects. And even then, you can unsubscribe anytime.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Who I Share Information With</h2>
        <p>
          I work with a few trusted partners to run this operation:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>PayPal</strong> - They handle all the payment processing securely</li>
          <li><strong>Shipping companies</strong> - They need your address to deliver your books</li>
          <li><strong>My web hosting service</strong> - They keep this website running</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          That's it. I don't sell your information to marketers, data brokers, or anyone else. Your privacy isn't for sale.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Keeping Your Information Safe</h2>
        <p>
          I take reasonable precautions to protect your personal information. The website uses secure connections (that's what the little lock icon in your browser means), and I only work with reputable service providers who also prioritize security.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, no system is 100% secure, and I can't guarantee absolute protection. But I promise to be responsible with your information and notify you if anything ever goes wrong.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          You have control over your information:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
          <li>You can ask me what information I have about you</li>
          <li>You can request that I correct any mistakes</li>
          <li>You can ask me to delete your information (though I might need to keep some records for legal or business reasons)</li>
          <li>You can opt out of any communications from me</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Just <a href="/contact" class="text-purple-700 hover:text-purple-900">reach out to me</a> if you want to exercise any of these rights.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
          If I need to update this privacy policy, I'll post the changes here and update the date below. For major changes, I'll try to give you a heads up via email if I have your contact information.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">Questions?</h2>
        <p>
          If you have any questions about this privacy policy or how I handle your information, please don't hesitate to <a href="/contact" class="text-purple-700 hover:text-purple-900">contact me</a>. I'm always happy to chat!
        </p>
